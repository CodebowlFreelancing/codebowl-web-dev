          <p>Welcome!</p>
          <p>
            Making a delicious bowl of ramen requires fresh ingredients, love for the craft and a professional artisan.
            The same could be said about engineering a first-rate software. Codebowl is a one-man software freelancing
            company devoted to serving functional meals prepared with modern tools, passion and skilful craftsmanship.
          </p>
          <p>
            Traditional ramen shops are humane places that take thorough care of the customer on top of feeding them.
            One can be heard, understood, have their problems relieved and worries lifted while enjoying a meal that
            will renew their strength and purpose. Such an experience is something Codebowl strives to provide as well.
          </p>
